Note 9 to 0A501:
A kit, including a replacement or repair kit, of firearms “parts”  or “components”  customarily sold and exported together takes on the classification of the most restrictive “part”  or “component”  that is included in the kit. For example, a kit containing 0A501.y and .x “parts,”  is controlled as a 0A501.x kit because the .x “part”  is the most restrictive “part”  included in the kit. A complete 0A501 firearm disassembled in a kit form is controlled as a firearm under 0A501.a, .b, or .y.7.
