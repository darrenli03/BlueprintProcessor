Technical Notes:
1. The word initiator or igniter is sometimes used in place of the word
detonator.

2. For the purposes of 1A007.b, the detonators of concern all utilize a small
electrical conductor (bridge, bridge wire, or foil) that explosively vaporizes
when a fast, high-current electrical pulse is passed through it. In non slapper
types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical detonation in a contacting high
explosive material such as PETN (pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper
detonators, the explosive vaporization of the electrical conductor drives a
flyer or slapper across a gap, and the impact of the slapper on an explosive
starts a chemical detonation. The slapper in some designs is driven by magnetic
force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to either an EB or a slapper-
type detonator.

Technical Notes for paragraphs a and b:
For the purposes of 1B101.a. and 1B101.b., the following definitions apply:

1. 'Fiber/tow-placement machines' and 'tape-laying machines' are machines that
perform similar processes that use computer-guided heads to lay one or several
'filament bands' onto a mold to create a part or a structure. These machines
have the ability to cut and restart individual 'filament band' courses during
the laying process.

2. A 'filament band' is a single continuous width of fully or partially resin-
impregnated tape, tow, or fiber. Fully or partially resin-impregnated 'filament
bands' include those coated with dry powder that tacks upon heating.

3. 'Fiber/tow-placement machines' have the ability to place one or more
'filament bands' having widths less than or equal to 25.4 mm. This refers to the
minimum width of material the machine can place, regardless of the upper
capability of the machine.

4. 'Tape-laying machines' have the ability to place one or more 'filament bands'
having widths less than or equal to 304.8 mm, but cannot place 'filament bands'
with a width equal to or less than 25.4 mm. This refers to the minimum width of
material the machine can place, regardless of the upper capability of the
machine.

c. Equipment designed or modified for the “production” of “fibrous or
filamentary materials” as follows:

c.1. Equipment for converting polymeric fibers (such as polyacrylonitrile, rayon
or polycarbosilane) including special provision to strain the fiber during
heating;

c.2. Equipment for the vapor deposition of elements or compounds on heated
filament substrates; and

c.3. Equipment for the wet-spinning of refractory ceramics (such as aluminum

License Requirement Notes

1. SAMPLE SHIPMENTS: Subject to the following requirements and restrictions, a
license is not required for sample shipments when the cumulative total of these
shipments does not exceed a 55-gallon container or 200 kg of a single chemical
to any one consignee during a calendar year. A consignee that receives a sample
shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample
shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated
to chemical weapons.

a. Chemicals Not Eligible

A. [Reserved]

B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC ). No CWC Schedule 2
chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to
States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part
745 of the EAR ) without a license.
---
b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to
part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any
chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license.

c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC
Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample
shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement
No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR ) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate
issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter
prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements).

d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in
the EAR : Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license
for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR . See, in particular, the
end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR , and the restrictions that
apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR .

e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual
written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must
be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of
Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s),
Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the
ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample
shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be
submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in
which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of
Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room 2099B,
Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.”

2. MIXTURES:

a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in
concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b through .d, are
controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements
specified in those ECCN s.

b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled
chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for
retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR 99.
However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR .

Note to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals:

a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole
purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations;

b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of
ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture,
including those that act as solvents.

3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350
may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use
Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require
a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR .

4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits
containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are
excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or
1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN
1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified
in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for
mixtures indicated in 1C350.)

Technical Notes:
---
1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or
gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together
under normal storage conditions.

2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in
the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases,
and hydrates.

3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract
Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of
the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates, isotopically-labeled forms or all
possible stereoisomers) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS
number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular
precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of
nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all
situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different
CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350
may also have different CAS numbers.

B. “Test”, “Inspection” and “Production Equipment” Technical Notes for 2B001 to
---
2B009, 2B201, and 2B991 to 2B999:
1. Secondary parallel contouring axes, (e.g., the w-axis on horizontal boring
mills or a secondary rotary axis the center line of which is parallel to the
primary rotary axis) are not counted in the total number of contouring axes.
Rotary axes need not rotate over 360°. A rotary axis can be driven by a linear
device (e.g., a screw or a rack-and-pinion).

2. The number of axes which can be coordinated simultaneously for “contouring
control” is the number of axes along or around which, during processing of the
workpiece, simultaneous and interrelated motions are performed between the
workpiece and a tool. This does not include any additional axes along or around
which other relative motions within the machine are performed, such as:

2.a. Wheel-dressing systems in grinding machines;

2.b. Parallel rotary axes designed for mounting of separate workpieces;

2.c. Co-linear rotary axes designed for manipulating the same workpiece by
holding it in a chuck from different ends.

3. Axis nomenclature shall be in accordance with International Standard ISO
841:2001, Industrial automation systems and integration—Numerical control of
machines—Coordinate system and motion nomenclature.

4. A “tilting spindle” is counted as a rotary axis.

5. 'Stated “unidirectional positioning repeatability” ' may be used for each
specific machine model as an alternative to individual machine tests, and is
determined as follows:

5.a. Select five machines of a model to be evaluated;

5.b. Measure the linear axis repeatability (R↑,R↓) according to ISO 230-2:2014
and evaluate “unidirectional positioning repeatability” for each axis of each
of the five machines;

5.c. Determine the arithmetic mean value of the ”unidirectional positioning
repeatability”-values for each axis of all five machines together. These
arithmetic mean values “unidirectional positioning repeatability” (UPR) become
the stated value of each axis for the model...) (UPRX, UPRy, . . .);

5.d. Since the Category 2 list refers to each linear axis there will be as many
'stated “unidirectional positioning repeatability” ' values as there are linear
axes;

5.e. If any axis of a machine model not controlled by 2B001.a. to 2B001.c. has a
'stated “unidirectional positioning repeatability” ' equal to or less than the
specified “unidirectional positioning repeatability” of each machine tool model
plus 0.7 μm, the builder should be required to reaffirm the accuracy level once
every eighteen months.

6. For the purpose of 2B, measurement uncertainty for the “unidirectional
positioning repeatability” of machine tools, as defined in the International
Standard ISO 230-2:2014, shall not be considered.

7. For the purpose of 2B, the measurement of axes shall be made according to
test procedures in 5.3.2. of ISO 230-2:2014. Tests for axes longer than 2 meters
shall be made over 2 m segments. Axes longer than 4 m require multiple tests
(e.g., two tests for axes longer than 4 m and up to 8 m, three tests for axes
longer than 8 m and up to 12 m), each over 2 m segments and distributed in equal
intervals over the axis length. Test segments are equally spaced along the full
axis length, with any excess length equally divided at the beginning, in
between, and at the end of the test segments. The smallest “unidirectional
positioning repeatability” -value of all test segments is to be reported.

Technical Notes:
1. In a scroll compressor or vacuum pump, crescent-shaped pockets of gas are
trapped between one or more pairs of intermeshed spiral vanes, or scrolls, one
of which moves while the other remains stationary. The moving scroll orbits the
stationary scroll; it does not rotate. As the moving scroll orbits the
stationary scroll, the gas pockets diminish in size (i.e., they are compressed)
as they move toward the outlet port of the machine.

2. In a bellows-sealed scroll compressor or vacuum pump, the process gas is
totally isolated from the lubricated parts of the pump and from the external
atmosphere by a metal bellows. One end of the bellows is attached to the moving
scroll and the other end is attached to the stationary housing of the pump.

3. Fluoropolymers include, but are not limited to, the following materials:

a. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE);

b. Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP);

Technical Note to Table on Deposition Techniques:
Processes specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as follows:

a. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modification
coating process wherein a metal, alloy, “composite” , dielectric or ceramic is
deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined
in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired
elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy for this
decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the
substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or “laser” irradiation.

Note 1: CVD includes the following processes: Directed gas flow out-of-pack
deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal decomposition (CNTD),
plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes.

Note 2: Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture.

Note 3: The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using
the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except
that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture.

b. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapor Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating
process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0.1 Pa wherein a source
of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material. This process results
in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately
positioned substrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the
coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary modification of
the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist
---
the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The
use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and
thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes. Specific TE-PVD
processes are as follows:

1. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material
which forms the coating;

2. Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating
sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and
uniform flux of evaporated coating species;

3. “Laser” Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave “laser” beams to
vaporize the material which forms the coating;

4. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which
forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a
momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the
cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a cone
attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber.
Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition;

Note: This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-
biased substrates.

5. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a
plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a
negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction
of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species,
evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to
provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of
coatings are ordinary modifications of the process.

c. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process
wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of:

1. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminum, chromium,
silicon or combinations thereof);

2. An activator (normally a halide salt); and

3. An inert powder, most frequently alumina.

Note: The substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is
heated to between 1,030 K (757 °C) to 1,375 K (1,102 °C) for sufficient time to
deposit the coating.

d. Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch)
which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials,
melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded
coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma
spraying or high velocity plasma spraying.

>Note 1: Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure.

Note 2: High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s
calculated at 293 K (20 °C) at 0.1 MPa.

e. Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating
process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended
in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or
painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the
desired coating.
---
f. Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer
phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards
the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting
ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on
an appropriately positioned substrate.

Note 1: The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter
deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of
deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to
permit vaporization of non-metallic coating materials.

Note 2: Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the
deposition.

g. Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the
element to be alloyed is ionized, accelerated through a potential gradient and
implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This includes processes in
which ion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical
vapor deposition or sputter deposition.

For the purposes of 3A001.a.5.a:

1. A resolution of n bit corresponds to a quantization of 2n levels.

2. The resolution of the ADC is the number of bits of the digital output that
represents the measured analog input. Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) is not
used to determine the resolution of the ADC .

3. For “multiple channel ADC s”, the “sample rate” is not aggregated and the
“sample rate” is the maximum rate of any single channel.

4. For “interleaved ADC s” or for “multiple channel ADC s” that are specified to
have an interleaved mode of operation, the “sample rates” are aggregated and

full scale analog signal frequency specified below 100 MHz; or

a.5.b.2.b. An 'adjusted update rate' exceeding 3,500 MSPS;

Technical Notes:
For the purposes of 3A001.a.5.b:

1. 'Spurious Free Dynamic Range' (SFDR) is defined as the ratio of the RMS value
of the carrier frequency (maximum signal component) at the input of the DAC to
the RMS value of the next largest noise or harmonic distortion component at its
output.

2. SFDR is determined directly from the specification table or from the
characterization plots of SFDR versus frequency.

3. A signal is defined to be full scale when its amplitude is greater than −3
dBfs (full scale).

4. 'Adjusted update rate' for DACs is:

a. For conventional (non-interpolating) DACs, the 'adjusted update rate' is the
rate at which the digital signal is converted to an analog signal and the output
analog values are changed by the DAC. For DACs where the interpolation mode may
be bypassed (interpolation factor of one), the DAC should be considered as a
conventional (non-interpolating) DAC.

b. For interpolating DACs (oversampling DACs), the 'adjusted update rate' is
defined as the DAC update rate divided by the smallest interpolating factor. For
interpolating DACs, the 'adjusted update rate' may be referred to by different
terms including:

• input data rate • input word rate • input sample rate • maximum total input
bus rate • maximum DAC clock rate for DAC clock input

Interconnects (FPICs). N.B.:
For integrated circuits having field programmable logic devices that are
combined with an analog-to-digital converter, see 3A001.a.14.

Technical Notes:
---
For the purposes of 3A001.a.7:

1. Maximum number of digital input/outputs in 3A001.a.7.a is also referred to as
maximum user input/outputs or maximum available input/outputs, whether the
integrated circuit is packaged or bare die.

2. 'Aggregate one-way peak serial transceiver data rate' is the product of the
peak serial one-way transceiver data rate times the number of transceivers on
the FPGA.

exceptions NAC and ACA.

Note 3 to 3A090:
For ICs that are excluded from ECCN 3A090 under Note 2 or 3 to 3A090, those ICs
are also not applicable for classifications made under ECCN s 3A001.z, 4A003.z,
4A004.z, 4A005.z, 4A090, 5A002.z, 5A004.z, 5A992.z, 5D002.z, or 5D992.z because
those other CCL classifications are based on the incorporation of an IC that
meets the control parameters under ECCN 3A090 or otherwise meets or exceeds the
control parameters or ECCN s 3A090 or 4A090. See the Related Controls paragraphs
of 3A001.z, 4A003.z, 4A004.z, 4A005.z, 4A090, 5A002.z, 5A004.z, 5A992.z,
5D002.z, or 5D992.z.

Technical Notes:
1. 'Total processing performance' ('TPP') is 2 × 'MacTOPS' × 'bit length of the
operation', aggregated over all processing units on the integrated circuit.

a. For purposes of 3A090, `MacTOPS' is the theoretical peak number of Tera (10
12) operations per second for multiply-accumulate computation (D = A × B + C).

b. The 2 in the 'TPP' formula is based on industry convention of counting one
multiply-accumulate computation, D = A × B + C, as 2 operations for purpose of
datasheets. Therefore, 2 × MacTOPS may correspond to the reported TOPS or FLOPS
on a datasheet.

c. For purposes of 3A090, 'bit length of the operation' for a multiply-
accumulate computation is the largest bit-length of the inputs to the multiply
operation.

d. Aggregate the TPPs for each processing unit on the integrated circuit to
arrive at a total. 'TPP' = TPP1 + TPP2 + . . . . + TPPn (where n is the number
or processing units on the integrated circuit).

2. The rate of 'MacTOPS' is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically
possible. The rate of 'MacTOPS' is assumed to be the highest value the
manufacturer claims in annual or brochure for the integrated circuit. For
example, the 'TPP' threshold of 4800 can be met with 600 tera integer operations
(or 2 × 300 'MacTOPS') at 8 bits or 300 tera FLOPS (or 2 × 150 'MacTOPS') at 16
bits. If the IC is designed for MAC computation with multiple bit lengths that
---
achieve different 'TPP' values, the highest 'TPP' value should be evaluated
against parameters in 3A090.

3. For integrated circuits specified by 3A090 that provide processing of both
sparse and dense matrices, the 'TPP' values are the values for processing of
dense matrices (e.g., without sparsity).

4. 'Performance density' is 'TPP' divided by 'applicable die area'. For purposes
of 3A090, 'applicable die area' is measured in millimeters squared and includes
all die area of logic dies manufactured with a process node that uses a non-
planar transistor architecture.

Note:
3A201.b does not control magnets “specially designed” for and exported “as
parts of” medical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging systems. The phrase
“as part of” does not necessarily mean physical part in the same shipment;
separate shipments from different sources are allowed, provided the related
export documents clearly specify that the shipments are dispatched “as part of”
the imaging systems.

c. Flash X-ray generators or pulsed electron accelerators having either of the
following sets of characteristics:

c.1. An accelerator peak electron energy of 500 keV or greater, but less than 25
MeV, and with a “figure of merit” (K) of 0.25 or greater; or

c.2. An accelerator peak electron energy of 25 MeV or greater, and a “peak
power” greater than 50 MW;

Note:
3A201.c does not control accelerators that are “parts” or “components” of
devices designed for purposes other than electron beam or X-ray radiation
(electron microscopy, for example) nor those designed for medical purposes.

Technical Notes:
(1) The “figure of merit” K is defined as: K = 1.7 × 10 3V 2.65Q. V is the peak
electron energy in million electron volts. If the accelerator beam pulse
duration is less than or equal to 1 μs, then Q is the total accelerated charge
in Coulombs. If the accelerator beam pulse duration is greater than 1 μs, then Q
is the maximum accelerated charge in 1 μs. Q equals the intergral of i with
respect to t, over the lesser of 1 μs or the time duration of the beam pulse Q=
∫ idt), where i is beam current in amperes and t is time in seconds.

(2) “Peak power” = (peak potential in volts) × (peak beam current in amperes).

(3) In machines based on microwave accelerating cavities, the time duration of
the beam pulse is the lesser of 1 μs or the duration of the bunched beam packet
resulting from one microwave modulator pulse.

(4) In machines based on microwave accelerating cavities, the peak beam current
is the average current in the time duration of a bunched beam packet.

Note 1:
4A906 applies to circuit model (or gate-based) and one-way (or measurement-
based) quantum computers. This entry does not apply to adiabatic (or annealing)
quantum computers.

Note 2:
Items specified by 4A906 may not necessarily physically contain any qubits. For
example, quantum computers based on photonic schemes do not permanently contain
a physical item that can be identified as a qubit. Instead, the photonic qubits
are generated while the computer is operating and then later discarded.

Note 3:
Items specified by 4A906.b include semiconductor, superconducting, and photonic
qubit chips and chip arrays; surface ion trap arrays; other qubit confinement
technologies; and coherent interconnects between such items.

Note 4:
4A906.c applies to items designed for calibrating, initializing, manipulating or
measuring the resident qubits of a quantum computer.

Technical Notes:
For the purposes of 4A906:

1. A 'physical qubit' is a two-level quantum system used to represent the
elementary unit of quantum logic by means of manipulations and measurements that
are not error corrected. 'Physical qubits' are distinguished from logical
qubits, in that logical qubits are error-corrected qubits comprised of many
'physical qubits'.

2. 'Fully controlled' means the 'physical qubit' can be calibrated, initialized,
gated, and read out, as necessary.

3. 'Connected' means that two-qubit gate operations can be performed between any
arbitrary pair of the available 'working' 'physical qubits'. This does not
necessarily entail all-to-all connectivity.

4. 'Working' means that the 'physical qubit' performs universal quantum
computational work according to the system specifications for qubit operational
fidelity.
---
5. Supporting 34 or more 'fully controlled', 'connected', 'working' 'physical
qubits' refers to the capability of a quantum computer to confine, control,
measure and process the quantum information embodied in 34 or more 'physical
qubits'.

6. 'C-NOT error' is the average physical gate error for the nearest-neighbor
two-'physical qubit' Controlled-NOT (C-NOT) gates.

(“APP ”)
“APP ” is an adjusted peak rate at which “digital computers” perform 64-bit or
larger floating point additions and multiplications.

Abbreviations used in this Technical Note
n number of processors in the “digital computer”

I processor number (i . . . . n)

ti processor cycle time (ti = 1/Fi)

Fi processor frequency

Ri peak floating point calculating rate

Wi architecture adjustment factor

“APP ” is expressed in Weighted TeraFLOPS (WT), in units of 10 12 adjusted
floating point operations per second.

Outline of “APP ” calculation method
1. For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-
point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital
computer” .

Note
In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or
multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations
---
per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in
fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing
calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective
calculating rate R is zero.

2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor

Ri = FPOi/ti.

3. Calculate “APP ” as

“APP ” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn.

4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.

Note 1:
For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition
and multiplication, each operation is counted.

Note 2:
For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the
pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.

Note 3:
The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its
maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP ” of the combination is
derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer
manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution
in a manual or brochure for the computer.

Note 4:
Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral
functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating
“APP ”.

failure of an inertial navigation unit is detected on the “aircraft” by
indications from the Control and Display Unit (CDU) or by the status message
from the corresponding sub-system. By following the manufacturer's manual, the
cause of the failure may be localized at the level of the malfunctioning Line
Replaceable Unit (LRU). The operator then removes the LRU and replaces it with a
spare. (2) 'Maintenance Level II': The defective LRU is sent to the maintenance
workshop (the manufacturer's or that of the operator responsible for level II
maintenance). At the maintenance workshop, the malfunctioning LRU is tested by
various appropriate means to verify and localize the defective Shop Replaceable
Assembly (SRA) module responsible for the failure. This SRA is removed and
replaced by an operative spare. The defective SRA (or possibly the complete LRU)
is then shipped to the manufacturer. 'Maintenance Level II' does not include the
disassembly or repair of controlled accelerometers or gyro sensors. Items:

including replacement of whole engines or engine modules.

Note 2:
USML Category XV(f) and ECCN s 9E001, 9E002 and 9E515 do not control the data
transmitted to or from a satellite or “spacecraft,” whether real or simulated,
when limited to information about the health, operational status, or
measurements or function of, or raw sensor output from, the “spacecraft,”
“spacecraft” payload(s), or its associated subsystems or components. Such
information is not within the scope of information captured within the
definition of “technology” in the EAR for purposes of Category 9 Product Group
E. Examples of such information, which are commonly referred to as “housekeeping
data,” include (i) system, hardware, component configuration, and operation
status information pertaining to temperatures, pressures, power, currents,
voltages, and battery charges; (ii) “spacecraft” or payload orientation or
position information, such as state vector or ephemeris information; (iii)
payload raw mission or science output, such as images, spectra, particle
measurements, or field measurements; (iv) command responses; (v) accurate timing
information; and (vi) link budget data. The act of processing such telemetry
data—i.e., converting raw data into engineering units or readable products—or
encrypting it does not, in and of itself, cause the telemetry data to become
subject to the ITAR or to ECCN 9E515 for purposes of 9A515, or to ECCN s 9E001

Technical Note:
For the purposes of 9E003.a.2.e, in 'pressure gain combustion' the bulk average
stagnation pressure at the combustor outlet is greater than the bulk average
stagnation pressure at the combustor inlet due primarily to the combustion
process, when the engine is running in a “steady state mode” of operation.

Note:
The “required” “technology” for holes in 9E003.a.2 is limited to the
derivation of the geometry and location of the holes.

Technical Notes:
1. For the purposes of 9E003.a.2.a, 'thermally decoupled liners' are liners that
feature at least a support structure designed to carry mechanical loads and a
combustion facing structure designed to protect the support structure from the
heat of combustion. The combustion facing structure and support structure have
independent thermal displacement (mechanical displacement due to thermal load)
with respect to one another, i.e., they are thermally decoupled.

2. For the purposes of 9E003.a.2.d, 'combustor exit temperature' is the bulk
---
average gas path total (stagnation) temperature between the combustor exit plane
and the leading edge of the turbine inlet guide vane (i.e., measured at engine
station T40 as defined in SAE ARP 755A) when the engine is running in a “steady
